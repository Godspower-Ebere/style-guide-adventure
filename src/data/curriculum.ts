      "Learn the basic structure of an HTML document, including the doctype, head, and body.",

    ],
    detailedExplanation: `
Welcome to your first day! Today, we dive into the world of HTML.

## What is HTML?
HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It's the standard language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. Think of it as the skeleton of a webpage. While other technologies like CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) are essential, HTML provides the fundamental structure.

Every website you visit, from Google to your favorite blog, is built on a foundation of HTML.

## The Basic Structure of an HTML Document
Every HTML document follows a standard structure. This ensures that web browsers can understand and render your page correctly. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the essential parts:

\`\`\`html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
\`\`\`

Let's break down this example:
- **\`<!DOCTYPE html>\`**: This declaration defines that the document is an HTML5 document. It's the very first thing in your HTML file and tells the browser how to interpret the code.
- **\`<html>\`**: This is the root element of an HTML page. All other elements are nested inside it.
- **\`<head>\`**: This element contains meta-information about the HTML document. This information is not displayed on the webpage itself but is used by browsers and search engines. It includes things like the page title, character set, and links to CSS files.
- **\`<title>\`**: This element specifies a title for the HTML page, which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
- **\`<body>\`**: This element defines the document's body. It contains all the visible content of the webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

## HTML Tags and Elements
HTML uses "tags" to mark up content.
- Tags are keywords surrounded by angle brackets, like \`<p>\`.
- Most tags come in pairs: an opening tag (e.g., \`<h1>\`) and a closing tag (e.g., \`</h1>\`).
- The closing tag is written like the opening tag, but with a forward slash (/) before the tag name.
- The combination of an opening tag, the content, and a closing tag is called an **HTML element**.

Some elements are "self-closing" and don't need a closing tag, like \`<br>\` for a line break or \`<img>\` for an image. We'll learn more about these later.

    title: "HTML Paragraphs and Text Formatting",
    category: "HTML Basics",
    description: "Learn how to structure text with paragraphs and apply formatting to emphasize and style your content.",
    learningObjectives: [
      "Use the <p> tag to create well-structured paragraphs.",
      "Understand how browsers handle whitespace and line breaks in HTML.",
      "Apply common text formatting tags like <strong>, <em>, <b>, <i>, and <u>.",
      "Differentiate between semantic (<strong>, <em>) and presentational (<b>, <i>) tags."
    ],
    detailedExplanation: `
Now that you can create a basic HTML page, let's focus on its most common content: text.

## Paragraphs: The \`<p>\` Tag
The \`<p>\` tag is one of the most fundamental tags in HTML. It defines a paragraph of text. Web browsers automatically add some vertical space (a margin) before and after each paragraph, which helps to separate them visually.

\`\`\`html
<p>This is a paragraph. It can contain one or many sentences.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph. The browser will render it separately from the one above.</p>
\`\`\`

## Whitespace and Line Breaks
A common point of confusion for beginners is how HTML handles whitespace. If you put multiple spaces or line breaks in your HTML code, the browser will collapse them into a single space when it renders the page.

To force a line break without starting a new paragraph, you can use the line break tag: \`<br>\`. This is a self-closing tag.

\`\`\`html
<p>This text is on one line.<br>This text appears on the next line.</p>
\`\`\`

## Text Formatting: Making Your Text Stand Out
HTML provides several tags to format text. It's important to distinguish between **semantic** tags (which add meaning to the content) and **presentational** tags (which just change the appearance).

### Semantic Formatting
- **\`<strong>\`**: Defines text with strong importance. Browsers typically render this as **bold**. You should use this when the text is semantically important.
  - Example: \`<strong>Warning:</strong> Do not touch.\`
- **\`<em>\`**: Defines emphasized text. Browsers typically render this as *italic*. Use this to change the meaning of a sentence.
  - Example: \`You *must* complete this step.\`

### Presentational Formatting
- **\`<b>\`**: Defines bold text without any extra importance.
  - Example: \`This word is in <b>bold</b>.\`
- **\`<i>\`**: Defines italic text, often used for technical terms, thoughts, or ship names.
  - Example: \`The term <i>hyperlink</i> is fundamental to the web.\`
- **\`<u>\`**: Defines underlined text. Be careful with this one, as users often associate underlined text with hyperlinks.
  - Example: \`This text is <u>underlined</u>.\`

**Best Practice:** Whenever possible, prefer using \`<strong>\` and \`<em>\` over \`<b>\` and \`<i>\`. It's better for accessibility (screen readers can use them to add vocal emphasis) and for search engine optimization (SEO).
