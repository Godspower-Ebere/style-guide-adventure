    "Define a flex container and understand its role.",
    "Control the primary layout direction with `flex-direction`.",

    "Master cross-axis alignment using `align-items`.",
    "Distinguish clearly between the main axis and the cross axis."

  detailedExplanation: `
Flexbox, short for the Flexible Box Layout Module, is a CSS layout model designed for one-dimensional layoutsâ€”either a row or a column. It provides an efficient way to distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.

### Core Concepts: The Two Axes

The power of Flexbox comes from its two axes:
- **Main Axis**: The primary axis along which flex items are laid out. Its direction is controlled by the \`flex-direction\` property.
- **Cross Axis**: The axis perpendicular to the main axis.

Understanding which axis is which is crucial. If \`flex-direction: row;\`, the main axis is horizontal, and the cross axis is vertical. If \`flex-direction: column;\`, the main axis is vertical, and the cross axis is horizontal.

### The Parent (Flex Container) Properties

To start using Flexbox, you apply \`display: flex\` to a container element. This enables a flex context for all its direct children.

\`\`\`css
.container {
  display: flex;
}
\`\`\`

Here are the essential container properties:

**1. \`flex-direction\`**
This property establishes the main axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed.
- \`row\` (default): Left to right.
- \`row-reverse\`: Right to left.
- \`column\`: Top to bottom.
- \`column-reverse\`: Bottom to top.

**2. \`justify-content\`**
This aligns flex items along the **main axis**. It helps distribute extra free space.
- \`flex-start\` (default): Items are packed toward the start line.
- \`flex-end\`: Items are packed toward the end line.
- \`center\`: Items are centered along the line.
- \`space-between\`: Items are evenly distributed; the first item is on the start line, the last on the end line.
- \`space-around\`: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around them.
- \`space-evenly\`: Items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items is equal.

**3. \`align-items\`**
This aligns flex items along the **cross axis**.
- \`stretch\` (default): Items stretch to fill the container (still respecting min/max-width).
- \`flex-start\`: Items are placed at the start of the cross axis.
- \`flex-end\`: Items are placed at theend of the cross axis.
- \`center\`: Items are centered in the cross-axis.
- \`baseline\`: Items are aligned such as their baselines align.

**Example: Perfect Centering**
To perfectly center a child element inside a parent, you can make the parent a flex container and use both \`justify-content\` and \`align-items\`.

\`\`\`css
.parent {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; /* Center on main axis (horizontal) */
  align-items: center;    /* Center on cross axis (vertical) */
  height: 300px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}
