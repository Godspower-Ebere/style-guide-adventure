## Hello and Welcome to Day 1!

Today we begin our journey into web development by learning the absolute foundation: **HTML** â€” HyperText Markup Language.

Think of HTML as the **skeleton** of a webpage. It defines what content appears, where, and in what order.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Understanding HTML's Role**  
   HTML is like the framework of a house. It structures your content: "Here's a heading", "Here's a paragraph", "Here's an image".

2. **Introducing HTML Elements (Tags)**  
   Tags are keywords in angle brackets like \`<p>\` or \`<h1>\`. They typically come in pairs:  
   \`\`\`html
   <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
   \`\`\`  
   The browser uses these to display your content properly.

3. **Essential HTML Document Structure**  
   A basic HTML page includes the following:
   - \`<!DOCTYPE html>\`: Declares you're using HTML5.
   - \`<html>\`: The root element of the page.
   - \`<head>\`: Contains metadata (not shown on the page).
   - \`<title>\`: Sets the browser tab text.
   - \`<body>\`: Contains all the visible content.

4. **Head vs. Body**  
   - The \`<head>\` holds invisible instructions (like the page title and links to CSS).
   - The \`<body>\` holds what the user sees (like headings and paragraphs).

### Code Example

\`\`\`html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Content visible on the page goes here -->
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is my first paragraph on my first webpage.</p>
</body>
</html>
\`\`\`

This is your basic starting template for any HTML document.
