  detailedExplanation: `
Welcome to your first day! Today, we dive into the world of HTML.

## What is HTML?
HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It's the standard language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. Think of it as the skeleton of a webpage. While other technologies like CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) are essential, HTML provides the fundamental structure.

Every website you visit, from Google to your favorite blog, is built on a foundation of HTML.

## The Basic Structure of an HTML Document
Every HTML document follows a standard structure. This ensures that web browsers can understand and render your page correctly. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the essential parts:

\`\`\`html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
\`\`\`

Let's break down this example:
- **\`<!DOCTYPE html>\`**: This declaration defines that the document is an HTML5 document. It's the very first thing in your HTML file and tells the browser how to interpret the code.
- **\`<html>\`**: This is the root element of an HTML page. All other elements are nested inside it.
- **\`<head>\`**: This element contains meta-information about the HTML document. This information is not displayed on the webpage itself but is used by browsers and search engines. It includes things like the page title, character set, and links to CSS files.
- **\`<title>\`**: This element specifies a title for the HTML page, which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
- **\`<body>\`**: This element defines the document's body. It contains all the visible content of the webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

## HTML Tags and Elements
HTML uses "tags" to mark up content.
- Tags are keywords surrounded by angle brackets, like \`<p>\`.
- Most tags come in pairs: an opening tag (e.g., \`<h1>\`) and a closing tag (e.g., \`</h1>\`).
- The closing tag is written like the opening tag, but with a forward slash (/) before the tag name.
- The combination of an opening tag, the content, and a closing tag is called an **HTML element**.

Some elements are "self-closing" and don't need a closing tag, like \`<br>\` for a line break or \`<img>\` for an image. We'll learn more about these later.
