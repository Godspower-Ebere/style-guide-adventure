  detailedExplanation: 
`## Hello and Welcome!
Welcome to Day 1 of your 100-day journey into web development! Today, we're starting with the absolute foundation: **HTML**.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

#### 1. Understanding HTML's Role
Imagine building a house. HTML is like the frame, the walls, and the rooms â€“ it defines *what* is there and *where* it is structurally. It tells the browser, "Here's a heading," "Here's a paragraph," "Here's a picture."

#### 2. Introducing HTML Elements (Tags)
HTML uses "elements" or "tags." These are keywords wrapped in angle brackets, like \`<p>\` or \`<h1>\`. Most elements have an opening tag (\`<tagname>\`) and a closing tag (\`</tagname>\`). The content you want to display goes between them. For example: \`<p>This is a paragraph.</p>\`. The browser reads these tags to understand how to structure the content.

#### 3. The Essential HTML Document Structure
Every basic HTML page needs a standard structure so browsers can process it correctly. This involves a few key tags that act as containers for the whole document.

#### 4. The Head and Body Sections
The main HTML content is split into two major sections: the \`<head>\` and the \`<body>\`.
*   The **\`<head>\`** section contains information *about* the page (like its title, which appears in the browser tab). This content isn't directly visible on the page itself.
*   The **\`<body>\`** section contains everything that *is* visible to the user on the page, like text, images, and buttons.

### Code Example: Basic HTML5 Document

Here is the fundamental structure of every HTML5 document.

\`\`\`html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Content visible on the page goes here -->
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is my first paragraph on my first webpage.</p>
</body>
</html>
\`\`\`

In this example:
*   \`<!DOCTYPE html>\` declares the document type.
*   \`<html>\` is the root element.
*   \`<head>\` contains the \`<title>\`.
*   \`<title>\` sets the text "My First Webpage" in the browser tab.
*   \`<body>\` contains the visible content: an \`<h1>\` (level 1 heading) and a \`<p>\` (paragraph).`,
