    "Understand what a Web Worker is and the problem it solves (blocking the main thread).",
    "Create and terminate a Web Worker.",
    "Communicate between the main thread and a worker using `postMessage()` and the `onmessage` event handler.",

  detailedExplanation: `
JavaScript is single-threaded, which means it can only do one thing at a time. If you run a long, complex calculation on the main thread, the entire user interface (UI) will freeze until it's finished. This leads to a terrible user experience.

**Web Workers** solve this problem by allowing you to run a script on a background thread, separate from the main execution thread. This means you can perform intensive tasks without affecting the responsiveness of your webpage.

### How Web Workers Work
1.  **Main Script**: Your main application code.
2.  **Worker Script**: A separate JavaScript file containing the code you want to run in the background.

The main script creates the worker and communicates with it by sending and receiving messages.

### Creating a Worker
You create a new worker by passing the URL of the worker script to the \`Worker\` constructor.

\`\`\`javascript
// üìÅ main.js
const myWorker = new Worker('worker.js');
\`\`\`

### Communication: \`postMessage()\` and \`onmessage\`
Communication between the main thread and the worker is handled through an event-based system.

*   To send data from the main script to the worker, you use \`worker.postMessage(data)\`.
*   To listen for messages from the worker in the main script, you use \`worker.onmessage\`.
*   To send data from the worker back to the main script, you use \`self.postMessage(data)\` (or just \`postMessage\`).
*   To listen for messages from the main script in the worker, you use \`self.onmessage\` (or just \`onmessage\`).

**Example:**

\`\`\`javascript
// üìÅ main.js
const myWorker = new Worker('worker.js');

// Send a message to the worker
myWorker.postMessage([5, 10]);
console.log('Message posted to worker');

// Listen for messages from the worker
myWorker.onmessage = function(e) {
  console.log('Message received from worker:', e.data); // e.data contains the message
}

// üìÅ worker.js
console.log('Worker script loaded');

self.onmessage = function(e) {
  console.log('Message received from main script:', e.data);
  const result = e.data[0] * e.data[1];
  
  // Send the result back to the main script
  self.postMessage(result);
}
\`\`\`

### Error Handling
You can listen for errors in the worker from the main thread using the \`onerror\` event handler.

\`\`\`javascript
// üìÅ main.js
myWorker.onerror = function(error) {
  console.error(\`Error in worker: \${error.message}\`);
};
\`\`\`
Inside the worker, you can use a standard \`try...catch\` block to handle errors.

### Terminating a Worker
To stop a worker from the main thread, you can call \`worker.terminate()\`. To stop it from within the worker itself, call \`self.close()\`.

\`\`\`javascript
// From main script
myWorker.terminate();

// From worker script
self.close();
\`\`\`

### Limitations
Web Workers operate in a separate context from the main thread and have no access to:
*   The DOM (you can't manipulate HTML elements).
*   The \`window\` object (but they have \`self\`).
*   The \`document\` object.
*   The \`parent\` object.

They are designed purely for computation.
