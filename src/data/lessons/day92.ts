    "Implement handlers (traps) like `get`, `set`, and `has` to intercept operations.",

  detailedExplanation: `
**Metaprogramming** is the idea of code that can inspect, analyze, and modify other code. JavaScript provides a powerful tool for this called **Proxy**. A Proxy object wraps another object (the "target") and allows you to intercept fundamental operations like property access, assignment, function calls, and more.

### Creating a Proxy
The syntax is straightforward: \`const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);\`.
*   **target**: The original object you want to wrap.
*   **handler**: An object that contains "traps"â€”methods that will be called when an operation is performed on the proxy.

### Traps and Handlers
Let's look at the two most common traps: \`get\` and \`set\`.

\`\`\`javascript
const user = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30
};

const handler = {
  // Trap for getting a property's value
  get(target, property) {
    console.log(\`Accessed property: \${property}\`);
    // Forward the operation to the original object
    return target[property];
  },

  // Trap for setting a property's value
  set(target, property, value) {
    if (property === 'age' && typeof value !== 'number') {
      throw new TypeError("Age must be a number.");
    }
    console.log(\`Set property \${property} to \${value}\`);
    // Forward the operation
    target[property] = value;
    return true; // The set trap must return a boolean indicating success
  }
};

const userProxy = new Proxy(user, handler);

console.log(userProxy.name); // Logs "Accessed property: name" then "Alice"
userProxy.age = 31;          // Logs "Set property age to 31"
userProxy.age = "thirty-two";  // Throws TypeError
\`\`\`

### The Role of \`Reflect\`
In the example above, we accessed the target directly with \`target[property]\`. This works, but it's not ideal. The modern best practice is to use the **\`Reflect\`** API.

\`Reflect\` is a built-in object that provides methods for interceptable JavaScript operations. Its methods have the same names as the proxy traps (e.g., \`Reflect.get()\`, \`Reflect.set()\`). Using \`Reflect\` ensures that the operation is forwarded correctly, preserving the original behavior, including the correct handling of \`this\`.

Here is the previous handler, rewritten with \`Reflect\`:
\`\`\`javascript
const reflectHandler = {
  get(target, property, receiver) {
    console.log(\`Accessed property: \${property}\`);
    // Use Reflect.get to forward the operation
    return Reflect.get(target, property, receiver);
  },
  set(target, property, value, receiver) {
    if (property === 'age' && typeof value !== 'number') {
        throw new TypeError("Age must be a number.");
    }
    console.log(\`Set property \${property} to \${value}\`);
    // Use Reflect.set to forward the operation
    return Reflect.set(target, property, value, receiver);
  }
};
\`\`\`
Proxies are the foundation of many modern libraries and frameworks (like Vue.js reactivity system) for tasks like data binding, validation, and debugging.
