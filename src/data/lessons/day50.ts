  detailedExplanation: `
While Flexbox is excellent for arranging items in a single dimension (a row or a column), CSS Grid excels at two-dimensional layoutsâ€”controlling both rows and columns simultaneously. It's the most powerful layout system available in CSS.

### Flexbox vs. Grid: When to Use Which?
- **Flexbox (1D)**: Best for distributing items along a single axis. Perfect for component-level layouts like navigation bars, form elements, or groups of buttons. Think "content-first".
- **Grid (2D)**: Best for overall page layout, arranging items into a fixed grid structure with rows and columns. Think "layout-first".

The two are not mutually exclusive; in fact, they work brilliantly together. A common pattern is to use Grid for the main page structure (header, sidebar, content, footer) and Flexbox to arrange the content *inside* each of those sections.

### Creating a Grid Container
Just like Flexbox, it all starts with a parent container.
\`\`\`css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
}
\`\`\`
This one line creates a grid context for all direct children, which become **grid items**. By itself, it won't do much. We need to define the structure of our grid.

### Defining Grid Tracks: Columns and Rows
The core of Grid is defining the tracks (the columns and rows).

**\`grid-template-columns\`**: Defines the number and size of the columns.
**\`grid-template-rows\`**: Defines the number and size of the rows.

You can use standard units like \`px\`, \`%\`, \`rem\`, or \`auto\`.

\`\`\`css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  /* Creates three columns: 100px wide, 200px wide, and 100px wide */
  grid-template-columns: 100px 200px 100px;
  /* Creates two rows, each 150px tall */
  grid-template-rows: 150px 150px;
}
\`\`\`

### The Magical \`fr\` Unit
The fractional unit (\`fr\`) is unique to CSS Grid. It represents a fraction of the available space in the grid container. This makes creating flexible, proportional columns incredibly easy.

\`\`\`css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  /* Column 2 will be twice as wide as columns 1 and 3 */
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
}
\`\`\`
The browser calculates the total available space, subtracts any non-flexible track sizes, and then divides the remainder among the fractional-unit tracks according to their proportions.

### Simplifying with the \`repeat()\` Function
If you have many tracks of the same size, the \`repeat()\` function is a fantastic shorthand.

\`\`\`css
/* Instead of this: */
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;

/* You can write this: */
grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
\`\`\`

### Spacing with \`gap\`
The \`gap\` property works exactly like it does in Flexbox, creating space (gutters) between grid tracks. It's applied to the **grid container**.

\`\`\`css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 16px; /* Creates a 16px gap between all columns and rows */
  column-gap: 20px; /* Or specify individually */
  row-gap: 10px;
}
\`\`\`
This is the modern, clean way to create gutters in your grid layouts.
