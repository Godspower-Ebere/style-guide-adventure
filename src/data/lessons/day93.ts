    "Use the `export` keyword to make variables, functions, and classes available to other files.",

  ],
  detailedExplanation: `
As applications grow, keeping all your code in one file becomes unmanageable. **Modules** in JavaScript solve this problem by allowing you to split your code into separate, reusable files. Each file is a module with its own scope, preventing global scope pollution.

### Why Use Modules?
*   **Organization**: Keep related code together.
*   **Reusability**: Write a function once and use it anywhere.
*   **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to debug and update.
*   **Dependency Management**: It's clear what code a module needs to run.

### Exporting from a Module
To make code available to other modules, you must **export** it. There are two types of exports:

#### 1. Named Exports
You can have multiple named exports per module. They are distinguished by their specific names.

\`\`\`javascript
// üìÅ utils.js

// Exporting variables
export const PI = 3.14159;

// Exporting a function
export function capitalize(str) {
  return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}

// Exporting a class
export class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
\`\`\`

#### 2. Default Export
You can only have **one** default export per module. It's used for the primary feature of a module.

\`\`\`javascript
// üìÅ calculator.js

// This class is the main thing this module provides
export default class Calculator {
  add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
  subtract(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Importing into a Module
To use exported code, you **import** it.

#### Importing Named Exports
You import named exports by using their exact names inside curly braces \`{ }\`.

\`\`\`javascript
// üìÅ main.js
import { PI, capitalize } from './utils.js';

console.log(PI); // 3.14159
console.log(capitalize('hello')); // Hello
\`\`\`

#### Importing a Default Export
You can give any name you want to a default import.

\`\`\`javascript
// üìÅ main.js
import MyCalculator from './calculator.js'; // 'MyCalculator' is an arbitrary name

const calc = new MyCalculator();
console.log(calc.add(5, 3)); // 8
\`\`\`

### Advanced Importing

*   **Aliasing**: Rename an import to avoid naming conflicts.
    \`\`\`javascript
    import { capitalize as makeFirstLetterUpper } from './utils.js';
    \`\`\`

*   **Module Object**: Import everything from a module into a single object.
    \`\`\`javascript
    import * as utils from './utils.js';
    
    console.log(utils.PI);
    const user = new utils.User('Alice');
    \`\`\`
