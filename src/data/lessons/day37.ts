    "Apply `float: left` and `float: right` to elements.",

  detailedExplanation: `
Before Flexbox and Grid became the standard for web layouts, the \`float\` property was the primary tool for creating multi-column designs. While it's no longer recommended for main page structure, it's important to understand for maintaining older codebases and for its original, intended use case.

## The \`float\` Property
The \`float\` property was designed to let content, like text, wrap around an element, like an image.
- **Values**: \`left\`, \`right\`, \`none\` (default).
- **Behavior**: An element with \`float: left\` is pushed to the left side of its container, and subsequent inline content flows around its right side. \`float: right\` does the opposite.
- **Flow Impact**: A floated element is taken out of the normal document flow. This means other block-level elements will behave as if the floated element isn't there, which can lead to layout issues.

\`\`\`html
<img src="avatar.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px;">
<p>This text will wrap around the floated image, creating a layout often seen in articles and magazines. The float property makes this effect easy to achieve.</p>
\`\`\`

## The Collapsing Parent Problem
The most common issue with \`float\` occurs when a parent element contains only floated children. Because the children are removed from the normal flow, the parent doesn't see their height and "collapses" to a height of zero.

\`\`\`html
<div class="container" style="border: 2px solid red;">
  <div style="float: left; width: 100px; height: 100px; background: lightblue;"></div>
  <!-- The red border of .container will not wrap around this box -->
</div>
\`\`\`

## The \`clear\` Property
The \`clear\` property is used to control the wrapping behavior. It specifies which sides of an element floating elements are not allowed to be on.
- **Values**: \`left\`, \`right\`, \`both\`, \`none\` (default).
- **Behavior**: An element with \`clear: both\` will move down below any floated elements that appear before it in the HTML. This is essential for creating footers or sections that must not be part of the floated layout.

\`\`\`css
.footer {
  clear: both;
}
\`\`\`

## The Modern Solution: The Clearfix Hack
To fix the collapsing parent problem, the standard technique is the "clearfix". It uses a CSS pseudo-element to add an invisible clearing element after the floated content, forcing the parent to expand.

\`\`\`css
.clearfix::after {
  content: ""; /* Must have content, even if empty */
  display: block; /* Makes it a block-level element */
  clear: both; /* The magic property that clears the floats */
}
\`\`\`

You apply the \`.clearfix\` class to the container of the floated elements.
\`\`\`html
<div class="container clearfix" style="border: 2px solid green;">
  <div style="float: left; width: 100px; height: 100px; background: lightblue;"></div>
  <!-- Now the green border correctly wraps this box -->
</div>
\`\`\`

**Today's Perspective**: For building entire page layouts (e.g., headers, sidebars, content, footers), always prefer **Flexbox** or **Grid**. They are more powerful, predictable, and designed for this purpose. Use \`float\` only for its original intent: wrapping text around an image within a block of content.
