    "Master combinator selectors to target elements based on their relationship.",
    "Utilize attribute selectors to style elements based on their attributes and values.",
    "Understand and apply pseudo-classes to style elements in specific states (e.g., :hover, :nth-child).",

  ],
  detailedExplanation: `
Advanced CSS selectors give you the power to target elements with incredible precision, leading to cleaner HTML and more maintainable stylesheets.

## Combinator Selectors
Combinators define the relationship between selectors.

### 1. Descendant Selector (space)
Selects all elements that are descendants of a specified element.
\`\`\`css
/* Selects all <p> elements inside a <div> */
div p {
  color: blue;
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Child Selector (>)
Selects all elements that are the direct children of a specified element.
\`\`\`css
/* Selects only <p> elements that are direct children of a <div> */
div > p {
  border-left: 3px solid red;
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)
Selects an element that is immediately preceded by a specified element.
\`\`\`css
/* Selects the first <p> that comes right after an <h1> */
h1 + p {
  font-style: italic;
}
\`\`\`

### 4. General Sibling Selector (~)
Selects all elements that are siblings of a specified element.
\`\`\`css
/* Selects all <p> elements that are siblings of and come after an <h1> */
h1 ~ p {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
\`\`\`

## Attribute Selectors
Style elements based on their attributes and attribute values.

\`\`\`html
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">External Link</a>
<a href="/about">Internal Link</a>
<a href="document.pdf" download>Download Link</a>
\`\`\`

\`\`\`css
/* Has the target attribute */
a[target] {
  background-color: yellow;
}

/* target attribute equals "_blank" */
a[target="_blank"] {
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* href attribute contains "example" */
a[href*="example"] {
  color: green;
}

/* href attribute starts with "https" */
a[href^="https"] {
  padding-right: 15px;
}

/* href attribute ends with ".pdf" */
a[href$=".pdf"] {
  color: red;
}
\`\`\`

## Pseudo-Classes
A pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s).

### User Action Pseudo-classes
\`\`\`css
a:hover { color: red; } /* When mouse is over it */
input:focus { border-color: blue; } /* When it has focus */
button:active { transform: translateY(1px); } /* When it is being clicked */
\`\`\`

### Structural Pseudo-classes
\`\`\`css
li:first-child { font-weight: bold; } /* First <li> in a list */
li:last-child { color: gray; } /* Last <li> in a list */
p:nth-child(2) { color: navy; } /* The second child, if it's a <p> */
tr:nth-child(odd) { background-color: #f2f2f2; } /* Odd rows in a table */
p:not(.fancy) { font-family: sans-serif; } /* Any <p> without the .fancy class */
\`\`\`

## Pseudo-Elements
A pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s).

\`\`\`css
/* Style the first line of every <p> element */
p::first-line {
  font-size: 1.2em;
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* Style the first letter of every <p> element */
p::first-letter {
  font-size: 3em;
  float: left;
  margin-right: 5px;
}

/* Insert content before every <p> element */
p::before {
  content: "-> ";
  color: green;
}

/* Insert content after every <a> with a specific attribute */
a[target="_blank"]::after {
  content: " (opens in new tab)";
  font-size: 0.8em;
  color: #555;
}

/* Style selected text */
::selection {
  background-color: #3498db;
  color: white;
}
