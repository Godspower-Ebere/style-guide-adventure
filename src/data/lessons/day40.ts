    "Establish a grid container with `display: grid`.",
    "Define columns and rows using `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`.",
    "Utilize the `fr` unit for flexible, proportional grid tracks.",
    "Control spacing between grid cells with the `gap` property.",
    "Place items onto the grid using line-based placement with `grid-column` and `grid-row`."

  detailedExplanation: `
While Flexbox excels at one-dimensional layouts, CSS Grid was designed specifically for two-dimensional layoutsâ€”controlling rows and columns at the same time. This makes it incredibly powerful for overall page layouts.

### Grid vs. Flexbox: When to Use Which?
- **Flexbox (1D)**: Best for distributing items along a single axis. Think navigation bars, lists of cards, or aligning items within a component.
- **Grid (2D)**: Best for the overall layout of a page or a significant component that requires alignment in both rows and columns. Think a full page layout with a header, sidebar, and content, or a complex photo gallery. They also work great together!

### The Grid Container

To begin, you apply \`display: grid\` to a container. This does not visually change anything on its own. You must define a grid structure.

\`\`\`css
.container {
  display: grid;
}
\`\`\`

### Defining the Grid Structure

**1. \`grid-template-columns\` and \`grid-template-rows\`**
These properties define the tracks (columns and rows) of your grid.
- \`grid-template-columns\`: Defines the number and width of columns.
- \`grid-template-rows\`: Defines the number and height of rows.

You can use standard units like \`px\`, \`%\`, or \`em\`.

\`\`\`css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 200px; /* Three 200px columns */
  grid-template-rows: 100px 100px; /* Two 100px rows */
}
\`\`\`

**2. The \`fr\` Unit**
The fractional unit (\`fr\`) is a new length unit designed for Grid. It represents a fraction of the available space in the grid container. This makes creating flexible grids incredibly easy.

\`\`\`css
.container {
  display: grid;
  /* A sidebar, a main content area that takes remaining space, and another sidebar */
  grid-template-columns: 150px 1fr 150px;
}
\`\`\`

**3. The \`repeat()\` function**
For grids with many identical tracks, the \`repeat()\` notation simplifies the code.

\`\`\`css
.container {
  display: grid;
  /* Creates 12 columns, each taking 1 fraction of the space */
  grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
}
\`\`\`

**4. \`gap\`**
The \`gap\` property (and its longhand versions \`row-gap\` and \`column-gap\`) defines the size of the gutters between grid tracks.

\`\`\`css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 20px; /* 20px gap between all rows and columns */
}
\`\`\`

### Placing Items on the Grid

Grid items are automatically placed into the cells you've defined. However, you can explicitly place them using grid lines. A grid with 3 columns has 4 vertical grid lines.

**1. Line-based Placement**
- \`grid-column-start\`, \`grid-column-end\`, \`grid-row-start\`, \`grid-row-end\`
These properties define where an item starts and ends on the grid.

**2. Shorthands: \`grid-column\` and \`grid-row\`**
These are shorthands for the start/end properties.
\`\`\`css
.item-a {
  /* Start on column line 1, end on column line 3 */
  grid-column: 1 / 3;

  /* Start on row line 1, end on row line 2 */
  grid-row: 1 / 2;
}
\`\`\`

You can also use the \`span\` keyword to define how many tracks an item should occupy.
\`\`\`css
.item-b {
  /* Start on column line 2 and span 2 columns */
  grid-column: 2 / span 2;
  grid-row: 2 / span 1;
}
\`\`\`
