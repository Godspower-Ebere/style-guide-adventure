  detailedExplanation: `
The CSS \`transform\` property lets you modify the coordinate space of an element. This allows you to move, rotate, scale, and skew elements. A key feature of \`transform\` is that it doesn't affect the layout of other elementsâ€”the space the element *originally* occupied is preserved. This makes it highly performant for animations.

### 2D Transform Functions

**1. \`translate(x, y)\`**
Moves an element horizontally and/or vertically.
- \`translateX(x)\`: Moves along the x-axis.
- \`translateY(y)\`: Moves along the y-axis.
Positive values move it right/down; negative values move it left/up.
\`\`\`css
.box {
  /* Moves the element 50px to the right and 20px down */
  transform: translate(50px, 20px);
}
\`\`\`

**2. \`scale(x, y)\`**
Changes the size of an element.
- \`scaleX(x)\`: Scales horizontally.
- \`scaleY(y)\`: Scales vertically.
A value of \`1\` is the original size. \`1.5\` is 50% larger, and \`0.5\` is 50% smaller.
\`\`\`css
.box:hover {
  /* Makes the element 20% larger on hover */
  transform: scale(1.2);
}
\`\`\`

**3. \`rotate(angle)\`**
Rotates an element around its center. The angle is specified in degrees (\`deg\`), gradians (\`grad\`), radians (\`rad\`), or turns (\`turn\`).
\`\`\`css
.icon {
  /* Rotates the icon 45 degrees clockwise */
  transform: rotate(45deg);
}
\`\`\`

**4. \`skew(x-angle, y-angle)\`**
Skews or distorts an element along the x and y axes.
- \`skewX(angle)\`: Skews along the x-axis.
- \`skewY(angle)\`: Skews along the y-axis.
\`\`\`css
.card {
  /* Tilts the element by 20 degrees along the x-axis */
  transform: skewX(20deg);
}
\`\`\`

### Combining Transforms & \`transform-origin\`
You can apply multiple transform functions in one declaration. **The order matters!** Transforms are applied from right to left.

\`\`\`css
/* This will first rotate the element, THEN scale it. */
transform: scale(1.5) rotate(45deg);

/* This will first scale the element, THEN rotate the now-larger element. */
transform: rotate(45deg) scale(1.5);
\`\`\`

The \`transform-origin\` property changes the point around which a transform is applied. The default is \`50% 50%\` or \`center\`.

\`\`\`css
.bar {
  transform-origin: left center; /* or 0 50% */
}
.bar:hover {
  /* The rotation will now pivot from the left edge */
  transform: rotate(90deg);
}
\`\`\`

### Introduction to 3D Transforms
To enter 3D space, the parent element needs a \`perspective\` property. This defines how "deep" the 3D scene is.

\`\`\`css
.scene {
  perspective: 800px;
}
.card {
  /* This card will now rotate in 3D space within the scene */
  transform: rotateY(45deg);
}
\`\`\`
Common 3D functions include:
- \`translate3d(x,y,z)\`
- \`scale3d(x,y,z)\`
- \`rotateX(angle)\`, \`rotateY(angle)\`, \`rotateZ(angle)\` (Z is the same as 2D rotate)
Using 3D transforms like \`translate3d(x, y, 0)\` can force hardware acceleration in browsers, leading to smoother animations even for 2D movement.
