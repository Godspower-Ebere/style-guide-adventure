  description: "Gain full control over your layouts by mastering the powerful alignment properties of Flexbox for positioning items along both axes.",
  learningObjectives: [
    "Master `justify-content` to align and distribute space between items along the main axis.",
    "Utilize `align-items` to precisely position items along the cross axis.",
    "Understand how `align-content` works to distribute space between multiple lines of flex items.",
    "Use `align-self` to override the default alignment for individual flex items."
  ],
  detailedExplanation: `
Flexbox's true power comes from its alignment capabilities. These properties give you fine-grained control over how items are positioned and how space is distributed.

### Aligning on the Main Axis: \`justify-content\`
This property defines how flex items are laid out along the **main axis**. It helps distribute extra free space.

- \`flex-start\` (default): Items are packed toward the start of the main axis.
- \`flex-end\`: Items are packed toward the end of the main axis.
- \`center\`: Items are centered along the main axis.
- \`space-between\`: Items are evenly distributed; the first item is on the start line, the last item on the end line.
- \`space-around\`: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around them. The space before the first item and after the last item is half the size of the space between two items.
- \`space-evenly\`: Items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.

\`\`\`css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
\`\`\`

### Aligning on the Cross Axis: \`align-items\`
This property defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the **cross axis** on the current line.

- \`stretch\` (default): Items are stretched to fill the container (still respects min/max-width).
- \`flex-start\`: Items are placed at the start of the cross axis.
- \`flex-end\`: Items are placed at the end of the cross axis.
- \`center\`: Items are centered in the cross-axis.
- \`baseline\`: Items are aligned such as their baselines align.

\`\`\`css
.container {
  display: flex;
  height: 200px; /* Container needs a height to see the effect */
  align-items: center;
}
\`\`\`

### Aligning Multiple Lines: \`align-content\`
This property aligns a flex containerâ€™s lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis. **Note: This property only takes effect on multi-line flexible containers, where \`flex-wrap\` is set to either \`wrap\` or \`wrap-reverse\`**.

Its values are similar to \`justify-content\`: \`flex-start\`, \`flex-end\`, \`center\`, \`space-between\`, \`space-around\`, \`space-evenly\`, and \`stretch\` (default).

\`\`\`css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  height: 400px; /* Container needs a height */
  align-content: center; /* Centers all the lines of items vertically */
}
\`\`\`

### Overriding Alignment: \`align-self\`
This property allows the default alignment (or the one specified by \`align-items\`) to be overridden for individual flex items.

It accepts the same values as \`align-items\` plus \`auto\` (default), which inherits the value from \`align-items\`.

\`\`\`css
.item-1 {
  align-self: flex-end; /* This specific item will be at the bottom */
}
.item-2 {
  align-self: center; /* This specific item will be centered */
}
\`\`\`
This is incredibly useful for creating exceptions in your layout without needing extra wrappers or complex selectors.
