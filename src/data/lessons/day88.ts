    "Understand the benefits of using a module system.",
    "Export variables, functions, and classes using named exports.",
    "Export a single value using a default export.",
    "Import values from other modules using `import`.",

  detailedExplanation: `
As applications grow, keeping all your JavaScript in one file becomes unmanageable. **Modules** allow you to split your code into separate files and share code between them. This improves organization, reusability, and maintainability. ES6 introduced a standardized module system built into the JavaScript language.

To use ES6 modules in the browser, you must tell the browser that a script is a module by adding \\\`type="module"\\\` to the \\\`<script>\\\` tag.
\\\`\\\`\\\`html
<!-- This script will be treated as a module -->
<script type="module" src="app.js"></script>
\\\`\\\`\\\`
Modules have some key characteristics:
*   They are automatically in **strict mode**.
*   Variables declared in a module are **scoped to that module** by default. They are not automatically added to the global scope.
*   You must explicitly \\\`export\\\` what you want to share and \\\`import\\\` what you need.

### Named Exports
You can export multiple values from a single file using the \\\`export\\\` keyword. These are called **named exports**.

\\\`\\\`\\\`javascript
// üìÅ utils.js

export const PI = 3.14159;

export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

export class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
\\\`\\\`\\\`

To import these, you use curly braces \\\`{}\\\` with the exact names of the exports.

\\\`\\\`\\\`javascript
// üìÅ app.js

import { PI, add, User } from './utils.js';
// The './' is important to specify a local file path.

console.log(PI); // 3.14159

const sum = add(5, 10);
console.log(sum); // 15

const user = new User('Alice');
console.log(user.name); // 'Alice'

// You can also import everything as a single object
import * as utils from './utils.js';
console.log(utils.PI);
\\\`\\\`\\\`

### Default Export
A module can have **one (and only one) default export**. This is useful for modules that have a primary purpose, like exporting a single class or function.

\\\`\\\`\\\`javascript
// üìÅ Greeter.js

export default class Greeter {
  constructor(greeting) {
    this.greeting = greeting;
  }
  greet(name) {
    return \`\\\${this.greeting}, \\\${name}!\`;
  }
}
\\\`\\\`\\\`

When you import a default export, you don't use curly braces, and you can give it any name you like.

\\\`\\\`\\\`javascript
// üìÅ app.js

import MyGreeter from './Greeter.js'; // The name 'MyGreeter' is arbitrary

const greeter = new MyGreeter('Hello');
console.log(greeter.greet('World')); // "Hello, World!"
\\\`\\\`\\\`

You can have both named exports and a default export in the same file.
\\\`\\\`\\\`javascript
// üìÅ app.js
import MyGreeter, { PI, add } from './someModule.js';
\\\`\\\`\\\`
