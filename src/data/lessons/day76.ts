    "Understand the benefits of modular programming.",
    "Export variables, functions, and classes using named exports.",
    "Use a single default export per module.",
    "Import code from other modules using `import`.",
    "Understand how to use modules in a web browser."
  ],
  detailedExplanation: `
As your applications grow, keeping all your code in one file becomes unmanageable. Modules allow you to split your code across multiple files, making it organized, reusable, and easier to maintain. ES6 introduced a standardized module system into JavaScript.

### The Core Idea
- Each file is its own module.
- You can choose what code to expose from a module (export).
- You can use that exposed code in other modules (import).

**Important Note for Browsers:** To use ES6 modules in a browser, you must tell the browser that your script is a module. You do this by adding \`type="module"\` to your \`<script>\` tag.
\`\`\`html
<script type="module" src="main.js"></script>
\`\`\`
This enables \`import\` and \`export\` statements and also changes some default behaviors (e.g., modules are automatically in strict mode).

### Exporting
There are two main types of exports: **named** and **default**.

#### 1. Named Exports
You can have multiple named exports per module. They are useful for exporting several utility functions or constants.

**Method 1: Inline**
\`\`\`javascript
// üìÅ utils.js
export const PI = 3.14;

export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

export class Person {
  // ...
}
\`\`\`

**Method 2: At the end**
\`\`\`javascript
// üìÅ utils.js
const PI = 3.14;
function add(a, b) { /* ... */ }
class Person { /* ... */ }

export { PI, add, Person };
\`\`\`

#### 2. Default Export
You can only have **one** default export per module. It's often used for the "main" thing a module exports, like a class or a primary function.

\`\`\`javascript
// üìÅ User.js
export default class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
\`\`\`
Or for a function:
\`\`\`javascript
// üìÅ greet.js
export default function(name) {
  console.log(\`Hello, \${name}\`);
}
\`\`\`

### Importing
You use the \`import\` statement to bring exported code into another module.

#### Importing Named Exports
You must use the exact names of the exports, wrapped in curly braces.

\`\`\`javascript
// üìÅ main.js
import { PI, add } from './utils.js';

console.log(PI); // 3.14
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5

// You can also rename imports
import { add as sum } from './utils.js';
console.log(sum(5, 5)); // 10

// Import everything as a single object
import * as utils from './utils.js';
console.log(utils.PI);
console.log(utils.add(1, 1));
\`\`\`

#### Importing a Default Export
You can give the import any name you like.

\`\`\`javascript
// üìÅ main.js
import MyUser from './User.js'; // The name 'MyUser' is arbitrary
const user = new MyUser("Alice");

import sayHi from './greet.js'; // The name 'sayHi' is arbitrary
sayHi("Bob");
\`\`\`

#### Mixing Imports
You can import default and named exports in a single statement.

\`\`\`javascript
// üìÅ some-module.js has a default export and a named export 'version'
import MyComponent, { version } from './some-module.js';
\`\`\`
